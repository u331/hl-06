/*6. Write a program that will enter numbers from the keyboard.
        The code for reading numbers from the keyboard must be in the readData method.
        The code inside the readData is wrapped in a try..catch.
        If the user entered some text, instead of entering a number, the method should catch the exception and display all previously entered numbers as a result.
        Numbers output from a new line preserving the order of input.*/
